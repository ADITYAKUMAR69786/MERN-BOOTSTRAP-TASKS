                <h3>Column 1</h3>
                <p>Landing my very first client was surprisingly easy thanks to the power of referrals. The startup I had been working for had just folded, and I turned to the network of marketing leaders I had built from that job and let them know the types of client work I was looking for: digital brand management, content creation, and paid media strategy. In no time, someone recommended me to a woman who was just starting to build her digital brand—and she is been a client ever since.</p>
                <p>Fast forward three years, and my freelancing business has changed a lot: Now I operate as an agency, BURT., which employs 13 people and has helped more than 100 clients with their digital strategy, representing over $1 million in work. What has not changed is that the bulk of that work—about 70 percent—has come from inbound referrals.</p>

                <h3>Column 2</h3>
                <p>I have found that referrals are the most powerful way to build a sustainable and thriving business (and its not just because I absolutely hate sales). Its so much easier for a potential client to say yes to a multi-thousand dollar investment when it's been pre-vetted and validated by a trusted source. Having a warm introduction can also reduce friction and make the initial sales conversation friendlier and more collaborative, rather than it feeling like I am forcing our services down someone's throat.</p>
                <p>So, the question I had to answer as I scaled from individual freelancer to business owner was: How can I fuel the referral fire? Here are three ways I have found to stay top of mind for folks and ensure there are more than happy to recommend our team to others.</p>

                <h3>Column 3</h3>
                <p>For instance, one common piece of advice is to ask your clients to share the work you've created together on social media and tag your business. But I have found that the second you start putting work on someone else—even a small ask like this—the execution falls off.</p>
                <p>Instead, we make it a no-brainer for clients to share by creating a cool graphic or highlight reel about our work together, posting it on our channels, and tagging them. Nine times out of ten, they are happy to re-share it to their audience because it's just so easy for them to do.</p>
